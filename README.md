## The Bone Klod source code

This is the source code for [The Bone Klod](https://gibonus.itch.io/the-boneklod),
developed in the context of the 2nd Bevy Game Jam.

You currently can't build it yourself, because it relies on patches of various
third party libraries I didn't yet publish.

This is intended to run with bevy 0.8, and I don't expect to update this
source code outside of fixing the build.
